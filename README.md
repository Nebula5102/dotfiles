# Dot Files
This repository includes my configuration for my Home-Manager, and Nix configs. There are additional configurations added for my personal use of the command line. The Home-Manager file home.nix contains the configuration of NVim, Starship, Kitty, and fish. Additionally you can find a custom theme designed using Lushify which I call NixNord. This theme is a take on the Nord Theming and uses all the same colour codes.

Feel free to clone the repository or use it as a reference for porting your own setup to Home-Manager.
